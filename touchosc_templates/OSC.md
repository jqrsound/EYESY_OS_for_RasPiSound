# Control via TouchOSC:

- Download and install the TouchOSC app for your iOS or Android device (it is not free, this app is well developed and it's nice to suppot this kind of effort)
- Download the fitting TouchOSC template to your device and import it via the app (in Layout).
- In the OSC setting of the app set Host to the IP adress of your Pi (your device and your Pi must be on the same network)
- Set the outgoing port to `4000` and ingoing to `4001`
- You're set!
